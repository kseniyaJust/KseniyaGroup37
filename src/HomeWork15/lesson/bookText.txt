In late September of 1974, Tabby and I spent a night at a grand old hotel in Estes Park, the Stanley.
We were the only guests as it turned out; the following day they were going to close the place down for the winter.
Wandering through its corridors, I thought that it seemed the perfect—maybe the archetypical—setting for a ghost story.
That night I dreamed of my three-year-old son running through the corridors, looking back over his shoulder, eyes wide, screaming.
He was being chased by a fire-hose. I woke up with a tremendous jerk, sweating all over, within an inch of falling out of bed.
I got up, lit a cigarette, sat in the chair looking out the window at the Rockies, and by the time the cigarette was done, I had the bones of the book firmly set in my mind.
